# MPhys Project: 
## Probing the formation and evolution of language in the multi-meaning USM

### Casimir Fisch, Sep 2022 -- March 2023

This repository contains the Python code used in this MPhys project. There is little structure to it besides the `general functions' file, 
which assembles most of the functions developed in the project to explore the model, and which is imported in most Python and Jupyter files
presented here.
